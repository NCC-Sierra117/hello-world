# hello-world
I need a dolla. 


Greetings, I'm underdeveloped and starting out on my quest to make a living with software. My current goals include launching some wbesites that are fully operational front and back end. Hopefully to learn some new and useful APIs. As well as eventually dive deeper into object oriented programming. My interests are wide but I want to focus in. It's nice to meet you. GO MICROSOFT!!!
